    "text": "1 Introduction\nWe chose this topic because we were both engaged in basketball as a kid. Discussions about favorite basketball teams and players always circle around NBA, about who is the best NBA basketball player or which team is the best basketball team. We also want to do statistical analysis and visualization of the play stlyes of different teams, and analyze what feature likely tell us that a team or player is considered good or better.\nIn case if you never played basketball or never watched NBA, NBA stands for National Basketball Association, it has 30 teams in total. 29 of the NBA teams are from USA and one team from Canada. The 30 teams are then divided into two different conferences. What we will look at is the data for the regular season, which starts in October and ends in mid-April. There will be 82 games in total. Teams will be ranked by their performance and only the top ranking teams are allowed to enter playoffs.",
